### Created by RealToughCandy (realtoughandy@gmail.com) ###
Scenario Title: “No Good Dev Goes Unpunished”

Team: 2 people

Level: Beginner

Prerequisites: Basic understanding of HTML & CSS, Git commands, and Slack.

Tech requirements: Slack channel membership, Github membership.

Purpose: **The purpose of the Git-Er-Dun series is to help developers improve their Git skills in a social,
collaborative environment where exploration and experimentation is encouraged. Using this method, devs can become more confident in their Git usage. A significant amount of remote dev jobs also require working knowledge of Slack.**


# Prework: #

A. You must configure Git and make sure it plays nice with GitHub. https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

B. To get the full experience from this simulation, please request membership to the Rockababy-Kroppenduckel Industries (RKI) GitHub organization. For the quickest response, email me at realtoughcandy@gmail.com. Once approved (don't worry, I'm fast), you will have clone, pull, and push rights to the repos.

C. There are a few instructional files in this folder with the .md  (Markdown) extension. If you want to read these in-browser, remember that browsers cannot
natively read these files. A lovely Markdown viewer for Chrome is available here as an extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en

D. For this exercise, you will use GitHub and Slack.

### Synopsis: Rockababy-Kroppenduckel Industries (RKI) is a full-service digital agency. You have been hired as a remote employee, tasked with giving the company’s home page some flavor with the help of a fellow remote worker. You two must use Git in conjunction with Github and Slack. ###

Instructions: Pick your character and follow the steps in the Steps.md file.
For example, both Dev 1 and Dev 2 complete Steps 1 and 2, while only Dev 1 completes Step 3.
